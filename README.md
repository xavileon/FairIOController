FairIOController
================

Implementation of the FairIO controller in Hadoop.

The paper describing the benefits of this controller will be published shortly. This is a prototype implementation, and the actual implementation "production ready" will be published in the following months (hopefully).

In the meantime, if you want to get a peek on what we try to do, take a look at the simulator in http://github.com/xavileon/FairIO-sim

Cheers!
